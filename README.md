# DeepSino
## Super Resolution of Undersampled Noisy 2D Sinogram using Deep Learning
It uses replica of DnCNN (Denoising Convolutional Neural Network) for denoising and super-resolution of sinogram. The project also contains a MATLAB GUI that has trained kereas network at backend to allow comparison between various reconstruction methods.
